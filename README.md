# Applejack:
	Applejack is an old 'CityRP' gamemode, based on Cider that was made by kurozael and edited by Lexi.
	If you're wanting to start a 'CityRP' server, you probably should just make your own gamemode instead of editing a 7 year old gamemode.

# Setup:
This gamemode is using FPTje's MySQLite module, so you can just install the gamemode like normal & use it, if you want to use MySQL edit sv_config.lua, I have made it alot easier for you to use this gamemode because it was already too hard!

# Update (13-04-2019):
You will need to have MySQLOO installed in order to make this gamemode work. Tested this with the latest version (9.5). https://github.com/FredyH/MySQLOO 

# Support:
	I'll support this gamemode for a little while, add me on steam for help; http://steamcommunity.com/id/Pawsativehi
